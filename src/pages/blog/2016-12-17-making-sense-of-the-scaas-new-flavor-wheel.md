## All good things must come to and end!

This older deck was all wood construction, and even though the original work was good, any wood construction has a limited life before it begins to fail. This one had been here for 12 years and started to rot and the owner didn't like how it looked anymore.  

We used the existing deck footprint, with new vinyl rails, steel posts wrapped in vinyl sheets and composite decking to give a fresh look that should last 30+ years!
